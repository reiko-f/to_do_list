# to_do_list

In this ToDo List application, PHP and MySQL work together to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. The basic flow of the application is as follows:

 * The user submits a form with a new task or edits an existing task.
 * The form data is sent to the PHP script, which processes the request.
 * The PHP script connects to the MySQL database and executes the appropriate SQL query to create, read, update, or delete the task data.
 * The database returns the result of the query to the PHP script.
 * The PHP script generates a response to the user, which may include displaying the updated task list or showing an error message.
